# MMM-UKNationalRail
Additional Module for MagicMirror²  https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror

# Module: UKNationalRail
This module displays live train departures from the specified station. Previous versions of this module pulled from [TransportAPI](http://transportapi.com/), however they have reduced their free tier limits to an unusuable level. Therefore, the module has now been updated to pull directly from the National Rail OpenLDBWS, more information available [here](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php?title=Main_Page).

## Using the module

Git clone from this repository into the modules sub-directory of the Magic Mirror installation, change directory into the newly cloned code and then run npm install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-UKNationalRail.git
cd MMM-UKNationalRail
npm install
```
To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```javascript
modules: [
                {
                        module: "MMM-UKNationalRail",
                        position: "top_right",
                        header: "Departures",
                        config: {
                                station: 'RDH',
                                token: "<INSERT TOKEN HERE>",
                        }
                },

## Credits & Contributions

This module was originally created by [Nick Wootton](https://github.com/nwootton/MMM-UKNationalRail) using [TransportAPI](http://transportapi.com/), but he chose to end supporting the module. In 2022, support was taken over by [Matt Dyson](https://github.com/mattdy/MMM-UKNationalRail), and was migrated to using [National Rail OpenLDBWS](http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration).

All contributions to the module are welcome, in the form of pull requests, or bug reports. If you wish to make a gesture of thanks towards the developer, please consider a small donation [via this link](http://paypal.me/mattdy90)
